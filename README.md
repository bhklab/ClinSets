# ClinSets: A Package for multimodal clinical trials for cancer patients focused on immunotherapy

The ClinSets R data package provides a repository of multimodal clinical trials for cancer patients focused on immunotherapy. Please refer to the manuscript URL (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36055464/). 

The following clinical immunotherapy datasets are also obtained from a cloud-based [ORCESTRA](https://www.orcestra.ca/clinical_icb) platform to ensure that the curation and processing of the clinical genomic data are fully transparent and reproducible. The following datasets are used in the biomarker discovery for immunotherapy response via pan-cancer and cancer-specific analyses.
