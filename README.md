# ClinSets: A Package for Multimodal Clinical Trials in Cancer Patients with a Focus on Immunotherapy

The ClinSets R data package provides a repository of multimodal clinical trials for cancer patients focused on immunotherapy. Please refer to the manuscript URL (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36055464/). 

The clinical immunotherapy datasets are also obtained from a cloud-based [ORCESTRA](https://www.orcestra.ca/clinical_icb) platform to ensure that the curation and processing of the clinical genomic data are fully transparent and reproducible. The following datasets are used in the biomarker discovery for immunotherapy response via pan-cancer, cancer-specific, and treatment-specific analyses. Note datasets with less than 20 patients are excluded.
